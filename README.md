# Arcade Card

An interactive card (or digital rave display??) with sylized arcade buttons and
customizable text. Because why not?

Adpted from the original---a birthday card for my eldest (see
[akw_dix](https://github.com/jeffwade/akw/tree/main/akw_dix)), created with
Processing (java). Also taking the opportunity to generalize and improve it, as well as to practice [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

## Running the sketch
### Locally
clone the repo and run `node app.js`
I like to use [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to auto-refresh

### Hosted
You can also play with the sketch on
[OpenProcessing](https://OpenProcessing.org).
